        <p>Be you gentleman, or be you scoundrel?</p> 
        <p>Questor, hope you're still with us on this journey down the Short North. We're happy to have you still here.</p>
        <p>You are still here?</p>
        <p>Excellent. We're going to dial back the shenanigans a bit, and return to our classy, genteel ways.
        Let's take a moment to appreciate and learn a little about other types of fermented organics. So, after mead, after beer, what could be next?</p>

        <p>Want to learn a bit about what happens when you pinch a grape? The knowledgeable sommeliers at Camelot Wine Bar
        will guide you through all you want or need to know about wine. So order up a glass of your favorite wine and enjoy a chill moment in
        the Great Frisby QR Quest.
        <p>No. Please do not ask the Best Man to pinch your grapes. She's much too rough.</p> 
        <h2>Uh, Are There Challenges?</h2>
        <p>Mead, Beer, Wine. Would we really make you do a physical challenge?</p> 
        <p>Yes. The Best Man demands it, she'll even work this one out with you. She's demanding, but not an asshole.<p>
        <p>Hope you aren't too drunk to tweet this.<p>
        <ul class="challenges">
          <li>Feat of strength: 10 standard push ups. No puking. Use your judgment. Don't cause a scene, skip it if you feel sloppy.</li>
          <li>Feat of generosity: Purchase 1 bottle of red or white wine for the bride and groom to enjoy in their wedded life.</li>
          <li>Epic Groom Challenge: The guest of honor, Jim Frisby, must seek out a male or female to dance the Charleston</li>
        </li>
        </ul>
